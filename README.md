# the_hunting
a *cheap* vuln finding robot. Currently in heavy Dev. So please, be careful with it.. Its a violent script if I've ever written one. Nothing is rate limited so you'll probably get IP blocked over it, specifically during gobuster dir if youre not already banned before getting there.
Cheers!

< Huge shoutout to my dude ![@1efty](https://twitter.com/ONEefty) for his help bringing this script into the 21st century! && ![@1efty](https://github.com/1efty)'s github  />

Already changing the world around us to fit our needs :muscle:

[proof](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/pull/330)

# Requirements

* a healthy dose of tenacity
* DigitalOcean Account *(for now)*
* doctl installed and configured
* Some API keys if you want good results for subdomain enum
* Works on Ubuntu 20.04 + ask @1efty

# Warning
Slack integration is included.. you need to add some data to aptly named files and you should be off to the races. Mind you, if you set up file upload by filling in the proper data in `./bot_user_oauth_at.txt` and `./slack_channel.txt`, you also need to have the a bot setup with the proper permissions to post files to whatever channel, then invite the bot to that channel.

Your data is in slacks hands then though, so if you are working within specific privacy and private program scopes, you may need to adjust course accordingly and do some research before you start dumping possibly important data on your targets into slacks servers and therefore the world. Be smart about it.

# Commands
## Set up `the_hunting.sh` on

install the hunting
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/incredincomp/the_hunting.git && cd the_hunting/
```

install pre-reqs make and packer
```bash
chmod +x reqs.sh
sudo ./reqs.sh
```

export your digital ocean api key to env
```bash
export DIGITALOCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN=1234546789abcdefghijkl
```

export your digital ocean ssh key fingerprint to env
```bash
export hunting_fingerprint=11:22:33:44:55:66:77:88:99:AA
```

## Building box
From inside /the_hunting.. run
```bash
make
```

##*How I make it work for me...*##

run --target then wait it out.. then when you get your notification you can just log back on and run `./the_hunting.sh --file ./target/date-time/responsive-domains-80-443.txt`

:heart: ~[@incredincomp](https://twitter.com/incredincomp)

### *THE INSTALL.SH SCRIPT IS SOMEWHAT TESTED, NOW BETTER FORMATTED, AND STILL MAYBE DANGEROUS.. GOOD LUCK*
need sudo for program installs with packaging program

```bash
sudo ./install.sh --install
```

## Usage

Pass this command your sshkey fingerprint from Digital that you would like to use for this box.

```bash
./the_hunting.sh --create $hunting_fingerprint
```

connect to your box

```bash
./the_hunting.sh --connect
```

delete your box

```bash
./the_hunting.sh --remove
```

Recon a root domain name for responsive subdomains

```bash
./the_hunting.sh --target hackerone.com
```

Exclude out of scope domains from your recon results before doing recon (leaving you with a clean scope subdomain list)

```bash
./the_hunting.sh --target hackerone.com --exclude support.hackerone.com,go.hacker.one,www.hackeronestatus.com,info.hacker.one,ma.hacker.one
```

Scan a CSV list of subdomains from the cli

```bash
./the_hunting.sh --scan sub.domain.com,sue.domain.com,paul.domain.com
```

Scan a file list of subdomains seperated by new line

```bash
./the_hunting.sh --file subdomains.txt
```

This will run all nuclei templates on your list of targets inside of `subdomains.txt`

```bash
./the_hunting.sh --file-all subdomains.txt
```

# To-Do/Upcoming
1. switching to aws, probably cheaper and easier to manage. Able to store data and probably just send some encrypted emails.. *maybe need a domain for that though* ![#34](https://github.com/incredincomp/the_hunting/issues/34)
2. fixing directory structure/house cleaning ![#30](https://github.com/incredincomp/the_hunting/issues/30)


# Methodology
